Shawn Hendrix from <strong><a href="http://keycodemedia.com/" target="_blank">KeyCode Media</a></strong> performs double duty as technical director AND on-screen talent using an iPhone 5 to control an unattended TriCaster in the production suite.

Control your TriCaster from anywhere using pre-programmed command sequences assigned to buttons on your smart phone.  Select inputs, run pre-recorded video from the DDRs, bring up graphics, connect to a TalkShow to add a Skype call into the production – or anything else – as if you were sitting at the control surface itself.

TriCaster has the ability to connect with a wide range of mobile devices.  For more, see:
