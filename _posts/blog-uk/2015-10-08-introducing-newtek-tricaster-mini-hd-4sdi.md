The new model provides customers a choice between professional SDI I/O and the highly popular, ultra-portable HDMI version of TriCaster Mini allowing even more users to transform their ordinary presentations into engaging multimedia content that looks like network-style TV.

“We’re pleased to offer customers a choice of models to support either their SDI or HDMI equipment depending on preference,” said Dr. Andrew Cross, president and CTO of NewTek.  “Not only professionals, people in every industry are seeking to deliver their messages like seasoned television professionals in order to engage their audiences. No other system in the world makes it as easy for them to create sophisticated broadcast content, webcasts, and presentations and stream them live, publish to social media or upload to a website from the office, an event, or any location with an Internet connection.”

TriCaster Mini HD-4sdi includes an integrated display screen and system storage capable of recording approximately 45 hours of footage.  The product is available immediately for $9,995 USMSRP. International pricing will vary.
