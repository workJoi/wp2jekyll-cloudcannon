Sienna has announced Sienna AutomationX now includes TriCaster support for integrated automated production control for news, sports, live events and multi-camera production.  Sienna AutomationX integration with TriCaster allows for seamless automation of the TriCaster with a wide variety of MOS production systems, including newsroom systems ENPS, Inception, iNews, Octopus, and OpenMedia.  Sienna and TriCaster integration brings a paradigm shift to the News industry, delivering fully automated production control with a price point an order of magnitude less than traditional systems.

Tamed Technology, provider of consultancy, training, integration and support services to the broadcast and content creation industries, plans to feature the Sienna AutomationX/NewTek TriCaster integration for newsroom control at Solutions Workshop at the EMC Booth at NAB 2015.  Tamed Technology has termed the combination as “delivering automated television newsroom production with high production values, at a disruptive price.”
