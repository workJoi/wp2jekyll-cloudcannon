TV Technology reviewer Joey Gill is chief engineer at WPSD-TV in Paducah, KY. He has worked in television since 1977, and brings a wealth of experience to his reviews.  Gill gives a thorough overview of the features and controls of TalkShow, and follows up with the details of his hand’s-on experience with TalkShow at NewTek headquarters.  There, he tested TalkShow’s handling of a Skype video call back to the newsroom at his home station, where a USB webcam was used for the call.  Gill noted the processing capabilities of the TalkShow can take incoming low-resolution video from such a source and smoothly rescale it to fit output needs.  He found that with the proc-amp controls he was able to adjust color balance and chroma levels to his liking very easily.  He also found the audio equalizer controls were well able to bring the audio portion of the program to his liking as well.  After doing A/B comparisons of video and audio with and without the TalkShow’s processing, he commented, “I can report that the processing feature alone is worth the price of TalkShow, not to mention its other broadcast features.”
