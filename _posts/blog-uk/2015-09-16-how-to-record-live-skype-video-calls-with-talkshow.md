During a live production, being able to record guest video interviews for archiving or post-production is important. This quick video tutorial explains how you can easily record full bandwidth Skype video calls to an external USB 3.0 hard drive or to a drive on your network using NewTekâ€™s TalkShow.

Recorded files will work with every major non-linear video editor on the market.

With TalkShow, you can record all channels of audio, including both ends of the call.
